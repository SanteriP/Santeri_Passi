      The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>, or <b>HTML</b> is the standard 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> 
      for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>. 
      It can be assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> 
      (CSS) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting languages</a>

      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document.

      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and
      &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such
      as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may
      include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
      but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
      JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion
      of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
      Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of
      the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
      presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used
      to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, in
      collaboration with javascript.
