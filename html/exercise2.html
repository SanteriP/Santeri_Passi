        The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous
        mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae
        and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the
        wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm
        cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human
        contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and
        their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
        various cat registries.[6]

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a
        strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws
        adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are
        well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing,
        purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as
        cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and
        dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species.
        It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
        such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] Cats also secrete
        and perceive pheromones.[8]

        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with
        litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats
        are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known
        as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and
        neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
        resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
        extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.[10]

        Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was
        long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats
        were venerated from around 3100 BC.[12][13] As of 2021, there are an
        estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the
        world.[14][15] As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular
        pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned.[16][17][18] In the
        United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of
        10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[19]

      <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
      <p>
        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be
        the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the
        6th century.[20] It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from
        an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine form
        suffixed with -t.[21] The Late Latin word may be derived from another
        Afro-Asiatic[22] or Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word kaddîska
        "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[23] The
        Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ. It is
        "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic
        word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and
        Arabic".[24] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European
        languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami
        gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian hölgy, "lady, female stoat"; from
        Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred animal)".[25]

        The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the
        16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low
        German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus,
        pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or
        puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply
        arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[26][27]
      </p>
      <p>
        A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[28] (or a gib,[29] if neutered). An
        unspayed female is called a queen,[30] especially in a cat-breeding
        context. A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern
        English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word
        catling.[31] A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a
        glaring.[32]
